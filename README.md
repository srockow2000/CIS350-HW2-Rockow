##Technical Background##
As an engineering major, I helped to design and create a robot that would be able to follow a line, detect walls, find balls, and score them. I used Arduino for this project. On my own, I have been experimenting with a Raspbery Pi b+, but I have not gotten far since I became distracted by school.
